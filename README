In a recent update, Notch and Mojang Specification added a query function to Minecraft servers.
Since I am learning Go, I thought I might make a Go application using this. After some consideration, I decided to release the library I developed for this.

It supports connecting to a server, requesting a "Challenge code" and querying for a short and long package.
I am aware of the horrible documentation, but that was not a high priority while coding.
It will be done, just not this weekend.
